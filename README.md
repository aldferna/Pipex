## Pipex üêö
The pipex project challenges you to emulate the behavior of the Unix shell command pipex, allowing users to redirect the output of one command as the input to another.  
Low-level programming concepts and a deep understanding of Unix system calls; handling file descriptors, processes, pipes, and command executions.  

## How to use:

1. Clone the repository:
```c
git clone https://github.com/aldferna/Pipex.git
```
2. Compile the project:
```c
make
```
3. Compile the bonus part:
```c
make bonus
```
4. Run the program with the following syntax:
```c
./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile
```

üóí **Example**
```c
./pipex input.txt "grep keyword" "sort -r" output.txt
```
To test the first part of the bonus, use three or more commands:
```c
./pipex input.txt "grep keyword" "sort -r" "wc -l" output.txt
```
